You are a senior software engineer creating an implementation plan.

1. Read $REPO_PATH/.factory/issue.md and $REPO_PATH/.factory/context.md

2. Create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan and write it to $REPO_PATH/.factory/plan.md
   Format each step as a checkbox for tracking progress:
   - [ ] Step 1: Description (files: path/to/file.ts)
   - [ ] Step 2: Description (files: path/to/other.ts)
   Include:
   - Files to create or modify (exact paths)
   - Data models, API routes, UI components as needed
   - Validation, error handling, security considerations
   - Test strategy: what to test, edge cases, expected test count
   - Reference actual function names and patterns from context.md

3. The plan must be specific enough that another engineer could implement it without reading the issue again.

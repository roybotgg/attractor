Execute the implementation plan step by step.

For each step:
- Create or modify the specified files
- Follow the conventions in the foundation blueprints
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Ensure each step builds on the previous one

Do not deviate from the feature blueprint. Do not implement anything listed in the blueprint's Out of Scope section. If the blueprint is ambiguous, make the simplest choice that satisfies the acceptance criteria.

Before completing, self-verify:
- Every acceptance criterion has corresponding implementation and tests
- No code was added for anything in the blueprint's Out of Scope section
- New code follows the conventions in the foundation blueprints
